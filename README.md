#Job Salary Analysis (Excel Project)
### Project Overview

This project is an interactive Excel-based salary analysis tool that helps users determine the median salary of a job based on:

              🌍 Country

             🕒 Job Schedule Type (Full-time, Part-time, Contract, etc.)

 ##Job Title

The goal is to help job seekers, analysts, and researchers quickly analyze salary trends across different countries and work types using structured Excel formulas and data filtering techniques.

## Project Objective

Many job seekers struggle to understand:

What is the realistic salary in a specific country?

Does schedule type affect salary?

What is the median salary for a job role?

This Excel tool solves that by dynamically calculating:

Median Salary = MEDIAN(filtered salaries based on selected filters)

### Features

✅ Dynamic filtering by:

Job Title

Country

Schedule Type

✅ Uses advanced Excel functions:

             MEDIAN()

            IF()

            SEARCH()

            ISNUMBER()

### Structured table references

✅ Ignores zero salaries automatically
✅ Works with large structured datasets
✅ Clean analysis-ready design

### How It Works

The core formula logic:

                      =MEDIAN(
                               IF(
                                      (jobs[job_title_short]=A2) *
                                      (jobs[salary_year_avg]<>0) *
                                      (jobs[job_country]=country) *
                                      (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(schedule,jobs[job_schedule_type]))),
                                     jobs[salary_year_avg]
                                  )
                        )

### What This Formula Does

Filters rows where:

Job title matches selected job

Salary is not zero

Country matches selected country

Schedule type contains selected schedule

Extracts valid salaries

Returns the median salary

This ensures:

Outliers don’t distort results

Zero values are ignored

Results are country-specific

Results are schedule-specific

### Why Median Instead of Average?

The median is used instead of the average because:

Salaries often contain extreme outliers

Median gives a more realistic central salary

Better for job market analysis
